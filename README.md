## Hi 👋 I'm Justin!

I'm an 18 year old Belgian student living in Singapore :)

Currently working on:
- oplight: a offline and online remote control that integrates with openHAB
- pythons: a collection of python projects I am making to learn the language (python)
- jus: portfolio website (vue, typescript)

Check out my past projects
- locket: the little corner for the people and events that matter in your life (swift, swiftui, ios/macos)
